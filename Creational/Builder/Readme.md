# Builder Pattern


### Intent

    **Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and 			representations of an object using the same construction code.


### Problem

   Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.
